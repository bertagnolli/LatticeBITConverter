# Lattice BIT file Converter
## I've created this batch file that will generate an SPI Flash binary (MCS) or Binary (BIN) from a Bitstream and automatically converts it to a HEX or BIN file, to be used with FlashCatUSB
## Some versions of FlashCatUSB will not flash the binary correctly if the extension is not HEX/BIN
##
## Before running the script please, copy files to your local computer
## Just run LatticeBITConverter.bat and follow the instructions
##
### Issue list:
###        
### LatticeBITConverter_v3
###        - BIN generation from MCS and BIT files is fully supported
###        - Created two new batch scripts that will allow user file input from window prompt as opposed to manually
###        - A number of new user input validations
